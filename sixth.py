To keep your stress level in check, take a few minutes each day to think over any unusual changes in your habits or physical health that may be spurred by anxiety.
Find a quiet place to sit down, and concentrate on feeling the seat beneath you. Then take long, deep breaths from your diaphragm; try inhaling through your nose for a count of four, holding for two, and exhaling through your mouth for seven. Exhaling longer than you inhale deepens your breathing, which helps calm your nervous system.
Sugary munchies spike your blood-glucose level, making you feel even more jittery. For a healthy yet stress-busting treat, dip fresh strawberries in dark chocolate sauce, Somer suggests. The fruit's vitamin C decreases stress-induced free radicals, while dark chocolate helps reduce stress hormones (such as cortisol) in the body. Another option: Snack on carrots or celery sticks. Chomping on crunchy (but healthy!) snacks helps you release pent-up frustration
Spending time with pals helps our bodies pump out the feel-good hormone oxytocin. So meet up with a friend at the end of a crazy-busy day, or call during your lunch break.
